# 📊 Data Automation for Sales Report Generation

## 📝 Project Overview
This **Python script** automates the process of generating **sales reports**. It reads multiple **CSV files**, processes the data, and generates a structured **Excel report** in just one click!

### What the Script Does:
- ✅ Reads multiple CSV files 📂
- ✅ Processes & summarizes sales data 📊
- ✅ Generates a well-structured **Excel report** in **one click**! 🖱️

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Automatically read and merge **sales data** from multiple CSV files.
- Calculate **total sales per product** 💰 and identify the **top 5 best-selling products** 🏆.
- Generate an **Excel report** with **raw data** and **summary data**.
- Ensure the script runs **automatically** once executed (no manual input required).

## 📍 Project Scope & Requirements

### ✅ Step 1: Read & Merge CSV Files
- The script should fetch all CSV files from a **specified folder**.
- Each file contains sales data with the following columns:
  - 📅 **Date**
  - 🏷️ **Product Name**
  - 📦 **Quantity Sold**
  - 💲 **Price per Unit**

### ✅ Step 2: Process the Data
- **Merge all CSV files** into a single dataset.
- Compute **total sales** per product 💰.
- Identify the **top 5 best-selling products** 🏆.

### ✅ Step 3: Generate an Excel Report
- The script should create an **Excel file** with two sheets:
  1️⃣ **Summary Sheet** → Total sales per product + Top 5 best sellers.
  2️⃣ **Raw Data Sheet** → All combined raw data from CSV files.

### ✅ Step 4: Save & Automate
- Save the final **Excel report** in a **specified folder**.
- The script should run **automatically** when executed (no manual input required).
